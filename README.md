A game for Ludum Dare. Not much time, will suck. You have been warned.

Somewhat based on the popular flash game Motherload (which I haven't played in 2 or 3 years).

Oh I also just realized that this is the name of the poem by Seamus Heaney... So you could say Constans (English teacher) inspired me :).
